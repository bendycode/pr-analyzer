# Proposal: Split Completed Work from ROADMAP.md

## Current Situation

The ROADMAP.md file is becoming quite long with completed items mixed with future work. This makes it harder to:
1. See what's actually planned vs what's done
2. Find specific future work items
3. Track the project's history effectively

## Recommended Practice

Following common open-source practices, I recommend:

### 1. **CHANGELOG.md** - For completed work
- Track all completed features, fixes, and improvements
- Organize by version/date
- Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
- Categories: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security

Example structure:
```markdown
# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [2025-05-26]
### Added
- Repository delete functionality with cascading deletes
- Clickable dashboard cards for navigation
- Batch processing for large repository syncs

### Fixed
- N+1 query issues in controllers
- Stuck sync status after job cancellation

### Security
- Admin authentication with Devise
- Invite-only admin system
```

### 2. **ROADMAP.md** - For future work only
- Keep only pending/planned items
- Organize by priority/phase
- Remove completed items (move to CHANGELOG.md)
- More focused and actionable

### 3. **Optional: ARCHITECTURE.md**
- Document major architectural decisions
- Explain key design patterns
- Keep technical debt items

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Documentation**: Each file has a clear purpose
2. **Better History**: CHANGELOG provides project evolution at a glance
3. **Easier Planning**: ROADMAP shows only what's ahead
4. **Standard Practice**: Follows conventions developers expect

## Migration Plan

1. Create CHANGELOG.md with all completed items from ROADMAP.md
2. Clean up ROADMAP.md to show only future work
3. Update ROADMAP.md header to reference CHANGELOG.md for completed work
4. Consider adding version tags to git for major milestones
