# Run Database Migration in Production

The sync_progress column migration exists but hasn't been run in production yet.

## To fix the error:

```bash
# Run the pending migration
heroku run rails db:migrate

# Verify the migration ran
heroku run rails runner "puts Repository.column_names.include?('sync_progress')"
```

## After migration is complete:

The failed jobs should automatically retry (Sidekiq will retry them).
If they don't retry automatically, you can:

```bash
# Check for failed jobs in Sidekiq UI
# Go to /sidekiq â†’ Retries tab

# Or manually retry via console
heroku run rails console
```

Then:
```ruby
# Retry all failed jobs
require 'sidekiq/api'
Sidekiq::RetrySet.new.each(&:retry)
```

The sync should then continue normally!
